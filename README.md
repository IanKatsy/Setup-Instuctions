# Setup-Instuctions
Instuctions for seting up the pack

- Both methods are for windows users. 
- If you are using Linux I feel you have the know-how to install the pack yourself.

## First Method:

- This method is for anyone lazy, will need more setup if the server pack changes.

# Installing the Ftb-App:
- Go to [The Overwolf page][ftb-app] and Download the app
- Run the installer (Probably saved to your [Downloads](%CSIDL_DEFAULT_DOWNLOADS%) folder)
