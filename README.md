# Setup-Instuctions
Instuctions for seting up the pack

- Both methods are for windows users. 
- If you are using Linux I feel you have the know-how to install the pack yourself.

# First Method:

- This method is for anyone lazy, will need more setup if the server pack changes.

## Installing the Ftb-App:
- Go to [The official download page][ftb-app] and Download the app.
- Run through the installer (Probably saved to your Downloads folder) and launch the app.
